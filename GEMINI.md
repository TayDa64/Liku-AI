# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - This file has been refactored

**GEMINI.md has been split into modular, game-specific documentation.**

## New Structure

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [LIKU-CORE.md](LIKU-CORE.md) | **Start here** - Setup, navigation, state file |
| [docs/ai/LIKU-CHESS.md](docs/ai/LIKU-CHESS.md) | Chess-specific instructions |
| [docs/ai/LIKU-SNAKE.md](docs/ai/LIKU-SNAKE.md) | Snake-specific instructions |
| [docs/ai/LIKU-TICTACTOE.md](docs/ai/LIKU-TICTACTOE.md) | Tic-Tac-Toe instructions |
| [docs/ai/LIKU-DINORUN.md](docs/ai/LIKU-DINORUN.md) | Dino Run instructions |
| [docs/ai/LIKU-SETTINGS.md](docs/ai/LIKU-SETTINGS.md) | Settings & AI Mode setup |

## Why the Change?

- **Smaller context** - Load only what you need for the current game
- **Model-inclusive** - Works for Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, etc.
- **Prioritized** - Each doc has TL;DR at top for quick reference
- **Maintainable** - Easier to update game-specific instructions

## Quick Start

1. Read `LIKU-CORE.md` for essential setup
2. Check state file for `CURRENT SCREEN`
3. Read the corresponding game doc

*This file is kept for backward compatibility. New instructions are in LIKU-CORE.md*
